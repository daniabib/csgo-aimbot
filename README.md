# CS:GO Yolov5 Aimbot

An aimbot that uses Yolov5 to play CS:GO. It is able to identify the characters from both teams

## How To Use

### In-game configuration
You have to turn OFF the Raw Input option in the game. With it on, the mouse signal goes straigth to the CS:GO engine without passing through the operating system. So, we need to turn if off so pyautogui can handle our mouse movement.

This setting is under the Mouse & Keyboard tab:
