# CS:GO Yolov5 Aimbot

An aimbot that uses Yolov5 to play CS:GO. It is able to identify the characters from both teams and it's heads. It uses pyautogui to handle the aim movement and mouse click.

## How To Use

### In-game configuration
You have to turn OFF the Raw Input option in the game. Otherwise, the mouse signal goes straight to the game engine without passing through the operating system and pyautogui can't handle it properly.

This setting is under the Mouse & Keyboard tab:
